# Maze Game

A simple interactive maze game built using Python and Tkinter. The game generates a random maze and allows a player to navigate from the starting position to the exit using buttons or arrow keys.

## Features
- Randomly generated maze with a guaranteed solution path.
- Player movement using arrow keys or UI buttons.
- Auto-solve feature that finds the shortest path to the exit.
- Reset button to generate a new maze.
- Graphical UI using Tkinter for an interactive experience.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the game:

```
pip install torch tkinter
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd maze_game_pytorch
   ```
